# Sample project ideas

### 1. Simple calculator (calculator.py)
Build a simple calculator program that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

### 2. Simple imput/print program (userdata.py)
Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color, and then prints out a message that includes this information.

### 3. Check prime number (checkprime.py)
Write a program that asks the user for a number, and then checks whether it is prime or not.

### 4. BMI Calculator (checkbmi.py)
In this program, the user enters their height and weight and the program calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides a message indicating whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

### 5. Grade Calculator: (studentsgrade.py)
In this project, you will create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their scores on various assignments and tests. The program will use control structures to handle input validation and calculate the final grade based on a predefined grading scale.

Here are the requirements for the project:
1. Prompt the user to enter the number of assignments and tests.
2. For each assignment, prompt the user to enter the score and weight (as a percentage) of the assignment.
3. For each test, prompt the user to enter the score and weight (as a percentage) of the test. 4 Validate the user's input to ensure that they are valid numbers.
4. Calculate the weighted average of the assignment and test scores to determine the student's overall grade.
5. Assign a letter grade based on the final grade using a predefined grading scale (e.g., A for grades 90-100, B for grades 80-89, etc.).
6. Print the final grade and letter grade to the console.

To implement this project, you will need to use loops (for) to iterate over the assignments and tests and calculate the weighted average of the scores. You can also use conditional statements (if/elif/else) to assign the appropriate letter grade based on the final grade.
