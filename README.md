# Sample programs to practice

Here is the sample programming questions to practice. Try them to code yourself. If you want help, you can download the program files (.py) from the repository.
File name of each program is given in the parenthesis.

### 1. Simple calculator (calculator.py)
Build a simple calculator program that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

### 2. Simple input/print program (userdata.py)
Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and favorite color, and then prints out a message that includes this information.

### 3. Check prime number (checkprime.py)
Write a program that asks the user for a number, and then checks whether it is prime or not.

### 4. BMI Calculator (checkbmi.py)
In this program, the user enters their height and weight and the program calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides a message indicating whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

### 5. Grade Calculator: (studentsgrade.py)
In this project, you will create a program that calculates a student's grade based on their scores on various assignments and tests. The program will use control structures to handle input validation and calculate the final grade based on a predefined grading scale.

Here are the requirements for the project:
1. Prompt the user to enter the number of assignments and tests.
2. For each assignment, prompt the user to enter the score and weight (as a percentage) of the assignment.
3. For each test, prompt the user to enter the score and weight (as a percentage) of the test. 4 Validate the user's input to ensure that they are valid numbers.
4. Calculate the weighted average of the assignment and test scores to determine the student's overall grade.
5. Assign a letter grade based on the final grade using a predefined grading scale (e.g., A for grades 90-100, B for grades 80-89, etc.).
6. Print the final grade and letter grade to the console.

To implement this project, you will need to use loops (for) to iterate over the assignments and tests and calculate the weighted average of the scores. You can also use conditional statements (if/elif/else) to assign the appropriate letter grade based on the final grade.

### 6. Write a program to write Fibonacci series (fibonacci.py)

The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. 

So the first few numbers in the Fibonacci series are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. The series is named after Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician who introduced the series to the western world in his book Liber Abaci, published in 1202. The Fibonacci series appears in many areas of mathematics and science, including number theory, geometry, and biology.

### 7. Write a function calculate_discounted_price that takes in three parameters: price, discount_percentage, and tax_percentage. The function should calculate the discounted price by applying the discount percentage to the original price, and then adding the tax amount to the discounted price. The function should return the final discounted price.
